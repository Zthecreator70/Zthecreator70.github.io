        <h1>Happy New Year Eve, Nemi</h1>
        <p>I've always noticed the way you see yourself... as if you’re someone’s second option. And every time I do, it quietly upsets me, because the truth is, whenever I see you, something in me melts. It’s like a fire starts in my chest, warm and impossible to ignore.</p>
        
        <p>I don’t understand how anyone could ever make you feel like an option. Your laugh alone has a way of softening the world, and your eyes tell stories that make it clear... you were never meant to be ordinary. You’re not like the other girls I’ve met. You never were.</p>
        
        <p>I’ll be honest with you. I was a coward for a long time. I liked you.... more than I ever admitted... but I convinced myself I wouldn’t be enough for you, that I might never meet your standards. So I did the easy thing, I buried my feelings and distracted myself with other women. It didn’t end well, and deep down, I knew why.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve changed since then. The old version of me... the reckless, immature, unbothered guy... he’s gone. I’ve grown, I’ve learned, and I finally understand what it means to be intentional with my heart.</p>
        
        <p>I admire you, Nemi... truly. I’ll make sure you always feel valued. And I regret the careless way I lived before, chasing people without thinking, without purpose. You deserved more than that... even back then.</p>
        
        <p>I don’t want you to ever feel like a second choice again. Not in my presence. Not in my world. If I’m here, it’s because I choose you... fully, confidently, and without hesitation.</p>

            They say nga na "ubos na ang dahilan para lumingon sa iba, libo-libong tala ngunit di ko na pansin na ikaw pala ang mas makintab sa loob, itatahan ka sa mga yakap kong walang lisang nagbabadya, ikaw at ikaw lang hanggang sa huling segundo ng pahinga."
